I am a current PhD candidate in statistics at the University of Toronto, and I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Dehan Kong](https://sites.google.com/site/kongdehanstat/) and Professor [Zhaolei Zhang](http://sites.utoronto.ca/zhanglab/). I am also a [CANSSI Ontario Multidisciplinary Doctoral Trainee](https://canssiontario.utoronto.ca/opportunities/uoft-opportunities/mdoc/). Prior to this, I received my bachelorâ€™s degree from the School of Mathematics, Sun Yat-sen University, China.

My research interests focus on developing statistical and machine learning methodologies for high-dimensional data analysis, optimal transport, non-Euclidean data analysis and non-parametric testing, with a particular emphasis on single-cell multi-omics and spatial transcriptomics. Additionally, I am also interested in theory and application of linear attentions for efficient sequence modeling.
