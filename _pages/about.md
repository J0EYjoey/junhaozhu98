I am a current PhD candidate in the Department of Statistical Sciences at the [University of Toronto](https://www.statistics.utoronto.ca), expected to graduate in 2025. I am very fortunate to be supervised by Professor [Dehan Kong](https://sites.google.com/site/kongdehanstat/) and Professor [Zhaolei Zhang](http://sites.utoronto.ca/zhanglab/). I am also lucky to be advised by Professor [Zhenhua Lin](https://blog.nus.edu.sg/zhenhua/) on particular projects. I am a [CANSSI Ontario Multidisciplinary Doctoral Trainee](https://canssiontario.utoronto.ca/opportunities/uoft-opportunities/mdoc/). Prior to this, I received my bachelor’s degree in 2020 from the School of Mathematics, [Sun Yat-Sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/sysuen/), China. I will join [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu) as a postdoctoral fellow in September 2025.

My research interests focus on developing statistical and machine learning methodologies for high-dimensional data analysis, optimal transport, non-Euclidean data analysis and non-parametric testing, with a particular emphasis on single-cell multi-omics and spatial transcriptomics. Additionally, I am also interested in theory and application of linear attentions for efficient sequence modeling.
